  <h1>Climbing App UX Case Study</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This case study explores usability research and design iterations made to improve the experience of selecting and navigating to climbing routes. The goal was to reduce confusion and enhance clarity for both new and experienced climbers using our app prototype.</p>

  <h2>Research Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate clarity of navigation flows</li>
    <li>Differentiate "approach" vs "parking" direction buttons</li>
    <li>Identify pain points in selecting climbs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Guerrilla usability testing with climbers and non-climbers using a Figma prototype. Participants completed core tasks such as selecting sectors, viewing routes, and accessing directions.</p>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Map Interaction:</strong> Users were unclear where to click on sector maps</li>
    <li><strong>Direction Confusion:</strong> Ambiguity between approach and parking directions</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Interactivity:</strong> Prototype lacked clear action triggers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Add clear map pins to indicate clickable areas</li>
    <li>Rename and label direction buttons for clarity</li>
    <li>Introduce structured "Info" tabs and mosaic photo galleries</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Persona: Taylor Watson</h2>
  <p>Intermediate climber balancing a tech career and outdoor hobbies. Seeks efficient planning tools and clear beta to make the most of limited weekend climbing time.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By aligning the app’s navigation and information display with real-world user needs, we created a more intuitive and enjoyable experience that supports safe, efficient, and inspiring climbing days.</p>
